- Homework assignment for Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, due April 29th, 2019. This is another Heroku-based app that also implements MySQL database to store data persistently. Utilizes Handlebars to dynamically create the page and update it as the user adds burgers or clicks the devour buttons. Custom ORM created for querying the SQL database with Express routing.
